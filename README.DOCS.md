# Node.js bindings for DAML

The [Node.js](https://node.js.org/) bindings for [DAML](https://daml.com/) allow you to write applications on the Node.js platform that interact with a DAML application through the [Ledger API](https://docs.daml.com/app-dev/ledger-api-introduction/index.html).

## Status

**The Node.js bindings are deprecated as of 2020-10-14.**

Either switch to the [JavaScript client
libraries](https://docs.daml.com/app-dev/bindings-ts/index.html)
running over the HTTP JSON API or to the [Java
bindings](https://docs.daml.com/app-dev/bindings-java/index.html)
which are based on the gRPC ledger API.
